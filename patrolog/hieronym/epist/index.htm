<p>In the earlier editions the letters of Jerome are grouped together

according to their subjects, and are for the most part ranked under three great

heads: <i>Theologicae</i>, <i>Polemicae</i>, <i>Morales</i>. This system being

altogether vague and unsatisfactory, the Benedictines selected from the mass

eighteen, including one from Pope Damasus, which refer directly to the

interpretation of the Old Testament, and these they distinguished by the

epithet <i>Criticae</i> or <i>Exegeticae</i>, placing them immediately before

the commentaries on the Scriptures. The remainder they endeavoured to arrange

according to their dates, dividing them into six classes, corresponding to the

most remarkable epochs in the life of the author, to which a seventh class was

added, containing those of which the time is uncertain; an eighth class,

containing five epistles dedicatory, prefixed to various translations from the

Greek; and a ninth class, containing some letters neither by nor to Jerome, but

which in former editions had been mixed up with the rest. In the second class,

however, they have thought fit to include all the biographical tracts of

Jerome; and in the third class all his polemical and apologetical works; while

in the fifth they have departed from their plan, for the purpose of presenting

at one view the correspondence with Theophilus and Augustin, although of these

epistles a few were written before some of those in the fourth class, and a few

after some of those in the sixth class. Vallarsi has, moreover, pointed out

several serious inaccuracies; and after a minute investigation, in the course

of which many letters hitherto received without suspicion have been rejected as

spurious, and others undoubtedly authentic collected, for the first time, from

various sources, has adopted the chronological order for the whole,

distributing them into five periods or classes. The first embraces those

written from A.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;370, before Jerome betook himself to the desert,

up to&nbsp;381, when he quitted his solitude and repaired to Rome; the second

those written during his residence at Rome from&nbsp;382 until he quitted the

city in&nbsp;385, and sailed for Jerusalem; the third those written at the

monastery of Bethlehem, from&nbsp;386 until the condemnation of Origen by the

Alexandrian synod in&nbsp;400; the fourth those written from&nbsp;401 until his

death in&nbsp;420; the fifth those the date of which cannot be fixed with

precision. The total number of epistles, including those written to, as well as

those written by Jerome, is in the Benedictine edition&nbsp;126, in the edition

of Vallarsi&nbsp;150.</p>
